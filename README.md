The application estimates the optimal travel destination using images shared by the user and their social media stream. We use the IBM Bluemix Visual Recognition API to process images and categorize them into the type of travel destination the user prefers (beach, mountain or urban holidays to name a few as examples). We use this to calculate the prior probability for the travel preference. Furthermore; using the Watson Personality Insights API, we parametrize and obtain probabilities of the personality of the user to be categorized as an adventurer or an art-lover; using textual data. Every city is characterized based on these traits based on type (beach, mountainous, urban) and preference for adventure-lovers or art-lovers. The recommender system takes in budget, duration and travel dates as inputs from the user. We then use the Amadeus API to calculate two way flights fare from user's location to a newly computed optimal destination list based on highest statistical match. On encountering a match, we notify the user that a potential travel arrangement is available. The notification is done proactively without expecting the user to request for one.
